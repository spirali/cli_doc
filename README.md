# `cli_doc` - Documentation generator for CLI

`cli_doc` generates HTML documentation for an application's command-line interface. 

`cli_doc` does not need to be compiled with the application; it just needs its executable. It automatically extracts information by (recursively) calling of the application with the `--help` option. 

Currently, `cli_doc` supports only CLIs that are generated by `clap` (or applications with a similar help format).
